   As far as I've seen and known, Mental health was/is never taken very serious around India,<br>
    unlike other social problems. Due to this most of the victims of <br>
    depression/suicidal are afraid to voice out their problems. <br
    >Though this is turning into a huge social bane, there are a very few to look into it.
    <br> I have always been a huge fan of the quote "Be the change, You want to see ", <br>
   And that is what has brought me to create this Page!.
       <h4>Live, Laugh, and Love!</h4>
